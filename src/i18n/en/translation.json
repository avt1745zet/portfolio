		"introduction": "<p><big>Hello, I'm Shane </big>. I'm a game front-end engineer with four years and eight months of experience. </p><p>My main professional skill is developing game front-end. I am familiar with TypeScript, Cocos Creator, Pixi.js, Unity, OOP, have some knowledge of Design Pattern, and have developed slot games and real-person chess and card games. My hobbies are playing games, reading books, and watching animations. I think my advantage is that I am very strict about the code, whether it is the relationship between categories or the naming of variables; my disadvantage is that sometimes I spend a lot of time on a few lines of code for the sake of readability and cleanliness... . The dream is to find a group of like-minded people to develop independent games in the future. </p>"

Although I have used Unity for a lot of time in college, I have used less experience in my career in the past, and my practical experience is relatively weak. However, if I need to use Unity in my work , I believe I can get started quickly, after all, the visual editor is still very close to the people compared to Terminal.</p>"
